# Google2FA for Lumen

### Google Two-Factor Authentication Package for Lumen
Package install:
composer require pvsv1984/lumen-2fa

Google2FA is a PHP implementation of the Google Two-Factor Authentication Module, supporting the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

This package is a Lumen update to  to [Google2FA for Laravel](https://packagist.org/packages/pragmarx/google2fa) package.

The intent of this package is to create a microservice safe way to implement 2FA Code and check responses against user.

### Recovery/Backup codes

if you need to create recovery or backup codes to provide a way for your users to recover a lost account, you can use the [Recovery Package](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/recovery). 

### Installation on Lumen
